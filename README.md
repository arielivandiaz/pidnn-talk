## PID Neural Networks
Small interactive web-based presentation I made for a seminar in Learning Systems class at Halmstad University. The presentation is based on cp's deck.js maths template, described below.

I also used [Google Charts Tools](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and Bret Victor's [Tangle](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) library for a demo, that illustrates how simple PID controller works.

## cp's deck.js maths template

A template to create slides with deck.js, MathJax, and the unicode Computer Modern fonts.

This contains everything you need to create a slideshow presentation which runs in the browser but uses the Beamer fonts and supports LaTeX maths.

[deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) is the best tool I've found to make HTML presentations.

I recompiled the cm-unicode project's Unicode version of the Computer Modern fonts (the default fonts used by LaTeX) so they could be used on the web. They can be downloaded from [http://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/](http://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/).

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) does the maths rendering.

You can see an example presentation at http://checkmyworking.com/misc/pgps-computable-groups-feb-2013/.
